# Creating and executing a pod (kubectl commands).
* list of cluster node executed on Nautilus
```
kubectl get nodes
```
* To list the **node = <pods, deployments, services, jobs>** that are attached to your namespace 
```
  kubectl get pods node
```
change the word node by one the modality defined as node.

At this point you don't have any pods on your namespace. Lets create a pods to lunch it and check the 
status of the pod. To create a pod we need to follow a structure file save as yaml extention. Lets create
folder called pods
```
  mkdir pods
```

Please download the file [tensorflow-pod] to your computer and save it on pods folder.
