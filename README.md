# NautilusTutorial
This repository contains a tutorial about how to get access and deploy your containers on your namespace. Even though, This tutorial does not intend to replace the original tutorial provided by nautilus support. The objective of the information provided in this repository is for those that are not familiar with working on a console and command environment. I highly recommend reading the original documentation that can be found [here](https://ucsd-prp.gitlab.io/userdocs/start/toc-start/)
