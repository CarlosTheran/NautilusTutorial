# NautilusTutorial
This repository contains a tutorial about how to get access and deploy your containers on your namespace. Even though, This tutorial does not intend to replace the original tutorial provided by **nautilus support**. The objective of the information provided in this repository is for those that are not familiar with working on a console and command environment. I highly recommend reading the original documentation that can be found [here](https://ucsd-prp.gitlab.io/userdocs/start/toc-start/).

## How to start
* First, you must go into [getting_access](https://github.com/CarlosTheran/NautilusTutorial/blob/main/getting_access/getting_access.md) folder to learn the process for requesting access into nautilus.

* Then, you want to go [creating execution a pod](https://github.com/CarlosTheran/NautilusTutorial/blob/main/creating%20executing%20a%20pod/kubectl_pods.md) folder, where you will find how to create and execute pod. Also, there you will find instructions on how to use JupyterHub for your containers.

* Once your pod is created and launched, there is an [example](https://github.com/CarlosTheran/NautilusTutorial/tree/main/example) that you can use to start familiarizing yourself with the nautilus environment and resources.
